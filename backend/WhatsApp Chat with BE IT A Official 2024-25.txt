12/09/22, 13:11 - Dr Preeti Patil, Dyp: Dear All,

I am extremely happy to share with you all about the opportunity by Reskilll which is an officiating partner with Meta (Facebook) on SparkAR Learn for a training program cum Hackathon at our institute. The program structure is divided into 3 broad stages:

In the 1st phase, we will walk the students through Spark AR studio and teach them how to create AR effect from scratch which involves: Importing assets, canvas, face tracking, patch editor and generating test link. (26th and 27th September 2022)- Online

In the 2nd phase, we will move a step further teaching students about advanced filters and share Spark AR policies before they finally submit their effect. Submission of the effect will get them a Meta Certification, and access to resources that will help them prepare for the hackathon. (5th October 2022 tentatively)- Offline

In the final phase we will host hackathons at campus level and at PAN India level. This 24-hour hackathon for the students will begin with yet another workshop followed by challenge allocation where students can select any challenge of their interest and build AR effects for that challenge. Top 10 effects will be selected to pitch in front of the jury panel and top 3 winners will be selected. (15th October tentatively)

Rewards for the top 3 winners of Campus Hackathon, in addition to Certificates are: 

Winner - OnePlus Buds Pro
RunnerUp - Amazon Alexa Echo Show
2nd RunnerUp - Amazon Alexa 4th Gen

I hope this message finds you well. It has come to my attention that some of you have been missing classes without a valid reason. I want to emphasize that we cannot have a thriving academic community without the active participation of all our students.

Furthermore, as you all know, our annual fest is coming up soon, and it is an event that everyone looks forward to. However, *if our attendance rates continue to suffer, we may have to cancel the fest.* So, I urge all of you to prioritize your education and attend your lectures regularly. 

I wish you all the best for the upcoming academic term.

Sincerely,
Dr. Mrs. P .Malathi
Principal DYPCOE, Akurdi

1: Don't switch tabs while attempting a test, or the test will be submitted automatically.¬†
2: Don't use ctrl c + ctrl v in the code editor because I did the same thing at my time. I copied the if statement and pasted it below, then HR asked if you copied and pasted the code (just for fun) but still don't use it.
3: You will be sitting in a hall with 100 students each, and HR will be supervising you.¬†
4: No phones will be allowed inside the office campus for test purposes.¬†

Focus on problem solving skills think first and then attempt the question.¬†
